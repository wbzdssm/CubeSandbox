# One-click runner for the per-component unit tests in this monorepo.
#
# The repo has no aggregate `make test`; each component is tested on its own,
# most inside the builder container via `make <component>-test` or a
# `builder-run` invocation. This script drives them all from one place, prints
# a clear "no unit tests" line for components that have none, and ends with a
# pass/fail/skip summary so a full sweep is a single command.
#
# By default it runs only the self-contained components (the green gate) and
# skips "gated" components that need a live database or a full VM. Naming a
# gated component explicitly (e.g. `run.sh hypervisor-kvm`) forces it to run.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/unittest/run.sh                 # run the default (self-contained) gate
#   tests/unittest/run.sh cubemaster agent   # run only the named components
#   tests/unittest/run.sh --list          # list components and exit
#   tests/unittest/run.sh --no-kvm        # skip components needing /dev/kvm
#   tests/unittest/run.sh -h | --help
#
# Component names are the keys shown by `--list` (lower-case, e.g. cubemaster,
# cubelet, agent, hypervisor). Exit status is non-zero if any run failed.

# --- component tables --------------------------------------------------------
#
# WITH_TESTS: "name|language|needs_kvm|command"
#   Self-contained unit tests that pass in the builder with no external deps.
#   These form the default green gate. command runs from REPO_ROOT; needs_kvm=1
#   means some tests require /dev/kvm and the whole component is skipped under
#   --no-kvm.
#
# GATED_TESTS: "name|language|needs_kvm|reason|command"
#   Components that DO have tests but need an environment the builder lacks
#   (a live MySQL/PostgreSQL/Redis, or a full VM for hypervisor integration
#   tests). Skipped by default so the sweep stays green, but run when named
#   explicitly (e.g. `run.sh cubelet`). This keeps them visible and runnable
#   without wedging the default gate on environment-only failures.
#
# NO_TESTS: "name|reason" — printed as an explicit skip so the absence of unit
#   tests is visible rather than silently missing from the sweep.
