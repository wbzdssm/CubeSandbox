"""
create_with_mount.py — Create a sandbox with host directories mounted inside it.

This is a Cube Sandbox extension to the E2B API. Host mounts are specified via
the `metadata["host-mount"]` field as a JSON-encoded list of mount descriptors.

Each descriptor has three fields:
  hostPath  — absolute path on the Cubelet host to bind-mount
  mountPath — target path inside the sandbox VM
  readOnly  — whether the mount should be read-only (True) or read-write (False)

Use cases:
  - Provide large datasets to a sandbox without copying them in
  - Share a read-only model/config directory across many sandboxes
  - Write sandbox outputs directly to a host path for persistence
