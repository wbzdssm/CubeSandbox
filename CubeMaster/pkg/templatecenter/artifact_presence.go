// artifactPresence describes whether a rootfs artifact's ext4 file is still
// backing its READY database row.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A rootfs artifact is two things that can drift apart: a row in
// rootfs_artifacts (status=READY, ext4_sha256, download_token) and a file on
// the node's local disk. Nothing keeps them in sync. The file disappears
// whenever the disk backing the artifact store is not durable across restarts
// (emptyDir instead of a PVC, a wiped host dir, an operator cleaning up by
// hand), while the row happily stays READY forever.
//
// Every consumer used to trust the row alone:
//
//   - the reuse path returned the READY row and skipped the build entirely,
//   - distribution passed its readiness guard on DB fields only and pushed a
//     CreateImage to cubelets,
//   - the download endpoint failed the pull with "artifact source missing"
//     without ever touching the row.
//
// The result was a permanent dead end: every retry took the same reuse path,
// re-distributed the same phantom artifact, and failed the same way. Probing
// the file lets the reuse and download paths demote the row so the very next
// create rebuilds it.

const (
	// artifactPresenceUnknown means the answer must not be acted on: either a

// A zero-length file is Missing rather than Present: mkfs.ext4 never produces
// one, so it is a truncated leftover that would fail the pull with
